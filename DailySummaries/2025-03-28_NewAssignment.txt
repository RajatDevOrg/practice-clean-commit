	•	I will set up Mailgun for testing emails.
	•	I will work on three files today: generateAbandonedCheckoutHtml.ts, generateCancelEmailContent.ts, and generateCompleteResearch.ts.
	•	In generateAbandonedCheckoutHtml.ts, I will fix the button colors and make it responsive.
	•	In generateCancelEmailContent.ts, I will wrap the HTML content in a basic structure for proper rendering and ensure responsiveness.
	•	In generateCompleteResearch.ts, I will make it responsive.
	•	I will test all three files on Gmail, iOS, and Outlook.
